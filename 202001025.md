## Lab 1 of Software Engineering Course.  
### Question 1
#### Functional Requirements:  
1. New User Registration - Allows to register with LIS and create an accoount for all transactions.  
2. User Login - LIS authenticates a member to allow them to avail the facilities.  
3. Search book - A member can search for a book based on title, publication, author etc.  
4. Issue Book - Allows a member to issue a specific book to their account.  
5. Return Book - To return a book issued earlier by a member.  
6. Reissue Book - To reissue a book.  
7. Add Book - Librarian can add and manage books.  
8. Overdue - The system should notify the librarian and the user about the overdue of books and calculate the fine.  


#### Non-Functional Requirements:  
1. Usability: The primary non-functional requirement for a library information system is usability. Everyone should be able to understand the user interface (UI) and find the necessary information without any extra training. Depending on the needs, other languages can be offered.  
2. Accuracy: Another crucial non-functional requirement for the library information system is accuracy. The information that is recorded about the books and the fines that are calculated must be accurate, dependable, and consistent.  
3. Availability: The System must be available flawlessly throughout the time the library is open and must be repaired in an hour or less if it malfunctions. The response time for requests from the system should be no more than two seconds.  
4. Maintainability: Adding new features and changing the software should be as easy as possible, and the software should be simple to maintain. The software must also be portable in addition to this.  



### Question 2
#### Scope  
* To create an impactful solution for anyone who can benefit from immproved accessibility to everyday sound events.  
#### Features 
* Mobile applocation.  
* Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to recognise sounds and notify the user through speech to text technology.
* Recognize key sound events of interest to the community such as emergency vehicle sirens and door knocks where immediate alerts and continuous logging is critical for the user.  
#### Non-functional Aspects  
* While there are many audio accessibility innovations in the app space up, up until the time of writing it has been mostly in the areas of sound amplification and text to speech/speech to text. This app is optimised for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for the users. 
* The UI should be user-friendly and easy to understand.
* The app should be accurate in detecting sounds.
